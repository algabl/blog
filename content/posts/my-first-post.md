Welcome to my blog. I hope you enjoy your time here.

I plan to share various thoughts and things I have learned throughout my time as a student at [Brigham Young University](https://byu.edu) and as a developer for the [McKay School](https://education.byu.edu) there, as well as any personal projects or future experiences I may have. Enjoy!

Alex
